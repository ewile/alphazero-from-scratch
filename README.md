# AlphaZero from scratch

An implementation of [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) (chess version) without any machine learning library. This project is not intended to provide good results. It was just a personal exercise to get me to understand the foundations of machine learning by reimplementing absolutely every step by hand (the different neural network layers, backpropagation, Monte-Carlo tree search...). As a result, no effort was made regarding GPU accelerations, and a sub-optimal language (java) was used.

PS: The quality of the code is questionable, I was young when I coded this ;)
